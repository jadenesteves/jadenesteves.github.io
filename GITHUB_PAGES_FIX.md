# GitHub Pages Loading Screen Fix

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

✅ **Asset Path Issues**: Changed all absolute paths (`/logo.svg`) to relative paths (`./logo.svg`)
✅ **PDF Links**: Fixed resume PDF paths in TypeScript modules  
✅ **Vite Configuration**: Proper base path configuration for GitHub Pages
✅ **Multiple Loading Screen Fallbacks**:
  - **CSS Animation**: Auto-hide spinner after 5 seconds
  - **HTML Script**: Emergency fallback after 6 seconds  
  - **TypeScript**: Immediate fallback after 3 seconds
  - **NoScript**: Works even without JavaScript

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Push Changes**: Commit and push all changes to main branch
2. **Enable GitHub Pages**: 
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
3. **Verify Deployment**: Check Actions tab for successful workflow

## 🧪 Testing

- Use `test.html` to verify GitHub Pages deployment
- Check browser console for any asset loading errors
- Verify all fallback mechanisms work

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

If still experiencing issues:
1. Check if repository is `jadenesteves.github.io` (should serve from root)
2. Verify GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
3. Ensure all assets are in the `dist` folder after build
4. Check browser developer tools for specific error messages

The site now has multiple layers of fallback protection against infinite loading screens.
