# Jaden Esteves Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects, resume, and contact information. The site is fully static, fast, and modern, with a custom animated starry sky background and a clean, responsive design.

## Features

- **Animated Starry Sky**: Dynamic, orbiting stars with smooth trails, centered on the profile image.
- **Dark, Modern Theme**: Cool purple color palette with beautiful cards and modals.
- **Project Gallery**: Projects are displayed as interactive cards, with support for "WIP" (Work In Progress) badges.
- **Project Modals**: Click a project to see more details, images, and links to code.
- **Resume Section**: View or download a PDF resume directly from the site.
- **Contact Section**: Email and GitHub links for easy communication.
- **Mobile Friendly**: Fully responsive layout for all devices.

## Customization

- **Add/Edit Projects**: Duplicate a project card in the HTML and update its content, or use the included JSON/project system if enabled.
- **Mark Projects as WIP**: Add `<span class="wip-badge">WIP</span>` inside a project card to show a "Work In Progress" badge.
- **Change Profile Image**: Replace `assets/images/jadene.jpg` with your own image.
- **Update Resume**: Replace the PDF in `assets/documents/`.
- **Colors & Styles**: Edit the `<style>` section in `index.html` for theme changes.
